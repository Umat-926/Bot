# Bot
It was Skillbox Machine Learning Course. I learnt to use python ![sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library to create a chat bot, you can test it right here in google colab 
This bot made with python. It can speak Russian and English little bit.
Chatbot doesn't have any program interface, you shall run it from command line
